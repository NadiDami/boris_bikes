#Boris Bikes
##Makers Academy Week 3 Project


###Aim

The aim of this project was to act as an introduction to Object Oriented Programming. We had to build a computer system that mimicked a simple version of the Travel for London Cycle Hire scheme

###Other details

The task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen, [@ecomba](http://www.github.com/ecomba)

I paired with Natalie Eskinazi, [@natalieesk](http://www.github.com/natalieesk)

###Features

* A person can rent a bike from a docking station
* A person can ride a bike (and have an accident whilst doing so)
* A person can return a bike to a docking station
* A station has hold bikes (up to a certain capacity)
* A station only allows working bikes to be rented
* A station releases broken bikes to a van
* A van delivers broken bikes to a garage
* A van collects fixed bikes from the garage and returns them to docking stations
* A garage fixes broken bikes

###To do

* Add more informative messages to explain what is going on e.g. *"Nadia has rented a bike"* or *"There are no bikes available at this docking station"*
